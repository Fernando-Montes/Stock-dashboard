#### Simple Moving Averages (SMA)

The Simple Moving Average is the average of the previous *n* values. Moving Averages are used to smooth the data in an array to help eliminate noise and identify trends. Moving averages may be used to not only identify a current trend but also as an entry and exit strategy. One of the simplest strategies relies on the crossing of two or more moving averages. The basic signal is given when the short-term average crosses above (stock price moving up) or below (stock price moving down) the longer term moving average.
