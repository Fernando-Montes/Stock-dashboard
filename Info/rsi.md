#### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The relative strength index (RSI) indicates whether over the last *n* days there are more days the price of the stock went up or down. 
It is defined as $RSI = 100\times\frac{\textrm{number of days stock went up over the last n days}}{n}$. Since the $RSI$ is in the range 0-100, a rule of thumb is that if the index goes above 30 in an upward trend, it is an indication of better days ahead. If it goes below 70 following a downward trend, it may be that the stock price will keep falling. It is usually used in combination with short-term moving-average (MA) crossovers since for example using a 10-day MA with a 25-day MA, the crossovers indicating a shift in direction will occur very close to the times when the RSI is either in the 30/70 or 20/80 range.
