## Introduction

This App can be used as a simple tool to obtain financial metrics information for any publicly traded company.  Information currently available through the App includes stock price, quaterly financial data (earnings, book value, etc), stock price forecasting and media news. The App was created with the purpose of helping me select when to buy and sell stocks. The signals section includes commonly used trading buying/selling signals. The indicators section includes commonly used valuation metrics and how they compare to other companies within the same industry. Stock price forecasting is done 5, 10 and 30 days ahead using Machine Learning algorithms. By switching between different tab panels, it is possible to compare and analyze different forecasting techniques and explore the in-sample and out-sample accuracies of each model. 

Financial information is updated daily using the [quantmod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/) and [tseries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tseries/) R packages.

I am a physicist at the [National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory](http://www.nscl.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I work at the intersection of nuclear physics and astrophysics by recreating the nuclear reactions which occur in astrophysical events in the lab. My main interest is to understand the origin of the elements in explosive secenarios and find out what stellar observations can tell us about matter in extreme astrophysical sites. In my spare time I like to venture into Machine Learning projects and finance.
